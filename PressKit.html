<p class="pg1">Hey! My name is mackenzie but you can call me mac. 
i work as the lead designer for the game studio behind humanity, im also a student in the past I’ve worked on asset and character design projects as well as a website i got interested in digital media because of my love for its culture and my hobbies steeped in the work, if i had to choose a biggest inspiration or favourite game studio it would have to go to Bethesda games studio and their titles such as Skyrim and the fallout series. I’m passionate about the gaming industry and it is my favourite hobby, my previous work includes asset and character design and I’m currently working as a student.
</p>
		<p class="pg2">given the opportunity to create a game i decided to go it something that resonates with my past and new audiences; a dark open world exploration game i think this type of game is super cool and the project turned out pretty awesome as a result. Here are some of my past projects:   </p>

		<p class="pg1">As for the current project im working on i decided to create a game with a simple cartoonish art style and as far as direction i wanted to take players to a brand new dystopia that hasnt been explored before. The game is estimated to take 2 and a half years to complete with a budget of around 2 million. As for the software and systems for all character design we are going through the adobe chain with photoshop animator illustrator ect and the game will be designed in the unreal engine. I hope to release the game  2022 january 10th and it will be available to purchase and play on pc and all major consoles.
